-- validate_product_publication_economics — BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE on products
-- A listing keeps the economics it was published with (T10a, #120). INSERT
-- needs a snapshot that matches system_settings. An UPDATE that leaves price
-- and shipping_cost unchanged keeps the snapshot immutable and is never
-- refused for stale settings, whatever the status (closure, suspension lift,
-- release, sale, #69). A legacy row with no snapshot may still receive one
-- from the backfill, validated against current settings. A price or
-- shipping_cost change is a new deal: it must carry a snapshot that matches
-- current settings and cannot clear the stored one.
